# Advent of Code 2020

This repository has my solutions for the 2020 Advent of Code. I didn't do these exercises in 2020 -- rather, I'm giving them a try after the 2021 Advent of Code, to get more practice with Rust.

My 2021 Advent of Code solutions aren't on GitHub yet -- they aren't organized into a single Rust package the way these ones are.

Note that you can run this repo's tests locally with `cargo test`.
